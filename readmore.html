    <h2 style="color: blue"> Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>With the increased use of solar energy as a distribution generation system, there is a lack of sufficient knowledge and data that will provide the locals with enough description on the concept of solar trackers. This project, therefore, seeks to design a solar tracking system that will help in maximizing the power from solar and providing sufficient data that will help the locals switch from the use of fixed solar panels.</p>

    <h2 class="about_subtitle" style="color: blue; font-family: poppin; "> Justification</h2>
      <p>Solar tracking system helps to increase the overall efficiency of solar energy production by tracking the sunâ€™s orientation maximizing the collection of solar irradiances. Since solar is a renewable source of energy it will reduce the dependence on non-renewable sources helping the country to meet the increased electricity demand.
        It also helps to reduce the stress on the distribution and transmission systems as it will act as a distributed generation system reducing the load connected which will help relieve congestion

    <ul>

    </ul>
        <li>To design a solar tracking system that will help in maximizing harvesting more solar energy</li>
        <li>To develop an algorithm that will enable the solar tracker movement based on the sun's position during the day.</li>
        <li>To evaluate the performance of the designed solar tracking system through simulation and experimental tests.</li>
